**Description:**

The importance of reducing credit risk has led a German financial institution to seek innovative solutions. 
Therefore, a precise and reliable machine learning model is created to more accurately assess the probability of credit default of its customers.


### **Description of Main Tasks:**

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Perform data cleaning, handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize/scale data.

2. **Data Exploration:** Analyze and understand the provided dataset, identify key variables, and create visualizations to understand relationships between variables and select relevant features.

3. **Model Building:** Experiment with various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, among others.

4. **Model Evaluation and Selection:** Evaluate models using metrics such as precision, recall, area under the ROC curve, and F1-score. Select the model with the best performance for predicting creditworthiness.
